# Truss-Analysis-Software

## Project Title
Truss Analysis Software

## Team Members
- Michael Yoofi Smith – Solver Engine, Truss Visualization and Licensing
- Nana Kwame Agyeman – User Interface & Input Module

## Course & Institution
- CE257 – Applications of Programming in Civil Engineering
- Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)

## Project Description
- This Python-based desktop application allows users to analyze 2D planar trusses. Users can define joints, members, support types, and loads, and the software will compute internal member forces and support reactions. 
- The application displays numerical results and a visual truss diagram showing the direction and magnitude of loads and reactions.

## How to Run the code 
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages:
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
3. Run the application using:
   python truss_analysis.py
