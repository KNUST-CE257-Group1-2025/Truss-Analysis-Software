## Project Description
- This Python-based desktop application allows users to analyze 2D planar trusses. Users can define joints, members, support types, and loads, and the software will compute internal member forces and support reactions. 
- The application displays numerical results and a visual truss diagram showing the direction and magnitude of loads and reactions.

## Project Structure
- `truss_analysis.py` – Main application code
- `roof.ico` – Icon for the application window
- `README.md` – Overview and usage instructions
- `requirements.txt` - Required python libraries to run source code
