📝 Project Description
This Python-based desktop application allows users to analyze 2D planar trusses. Users can define joints, members, support types, and loads, and the software will compute internal member forces and support reactions. 
The application displays numerical results and a visual truss diagram showing the direction and magnitude of loads and reactions.

🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages:
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
3. Run the application using:
   python truss_analysis.py
